In the case of our Tragedy Index, we assign points for tragic events that can be gleaned from the events and attributes of individuals and their families. The use of points and scores implies a game perspective on the life of individuals and allows us to see the most tragic--or highest scoring in tragedy--individuals in Kindred Britain, as shown here. This took a dialectic approach, with the first tragedy index based solely on the lifespan of the individual and their parents and children. The individual scored a point if:

One died before the age of 45.
One’s parents died before one was the age of 13.
One’s children died before the child was the age of 13.
Along with these initial measures, we attempted to identify other tragic events that might be visible to a computational lens. We went on to try to determine if someone died of violence by reading descriptions of his or her death and searching for the following keywords: battle, wounds, killed in action, hanged, shot, executed, beheaded, tower hill, Tyburn, murdered, stabbed, suicide, killed himself, killed herself or cwgc.org in the description of their death event. If this was the case, then that individual would get a point for dying young or of violence regardless of the age of their death. A point was also awarded for mental illness based on the presence of keywords insane, breakdown, or lunatic in any events associated with the individual. Finally, a point was awarded for the death of every sibling before that sibling reaches the age of 13.
